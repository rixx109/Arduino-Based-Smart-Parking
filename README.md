Make connections as per the code to the hcsr04 Ultrasonic sensor.
In order to turn on bulb with the sensor we need to use relay for it.

Connect live from AC directly to the BULB.
Connect neutral from AC to the common of the relay.
Take a wire and connect it to the NO(Normally Open of the relay) and attach it to the neutral of the bulb.
